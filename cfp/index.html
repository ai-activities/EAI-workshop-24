    <h2>Topic of interest (including but not limited to)</h2>
    <p>
        This workshop will provide a premium platform for both research and industry from different backgrounds to exchange ideas on opportunities, challenges, and cutting-edge techniques in ethical AI. We encourage submissions in various degrees of progress, such as new results, visions, techniques, innovative application papers, and progress reports under the topics that include, but are not limited to, the following broad categories:
    </p>
        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Algorithmic fairness and bias on classifying and clustering big data </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Human-in-the-loop for ethical-aware machine learning </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Ethical recommender systems and diversity in recommendation  </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Learning ethical-aware representation on heterogeneous data domains </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Causality-based fairness in high-dimensional data  </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Integration of observation for causality-based bias control </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Preserving fairness in graph embedding </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Novel visualization techniques to facilitate the query and analysis of data bias </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Robustness and generalization of large language models</li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Bias mitigation and fairness of large language models</li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">Explainability, interpretability, privacy and security of large language models</li>
          <li style="list-style-type:square">First hand experience creating or with company practices for ethical AI </li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        And with particular focuses but not limited to these application domains:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Application of ethical AI methods in large-scale data mining </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Computer vision (fairness in face recognition, object relation; debiasing in image processing and video) </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Natural language processing (fair text generation, semantic parsing) </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Reinforcement learning (fairness-aware multi-agent learning, compositional imitation learning) </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Social science (racial profiling, institutional racism) </li>

    <h2>CFP Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        Submissions are limited to a total of 5 pages, including all content and references. 
        There will be no page limit for supplemental materials. 
        All submissions must be in PDF format and use ACM Conference Proceeding templates (two-column format). 
        One recommended setting for Latex file of anonymous manuscript is: <strong>\documentclass[sigconf, anonymous, review]{acmart}</strong>. 
        Template guidelines are here: <a href = "https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following this KDD conference submission policy, reviews are double-blind, and author names and affiliations should NOT be listed. 
        Submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity of writing. 
        For papers that rely heavily on empirical evaluations, the experimental methods and results should be clear, well-executed, and repeatable. 
        Authors are strongly encouraged to make data and code publicly available whenever possible. 
        The accepted papers will be posted on the workshop website but will not be included in the KDD proceedings. 
    </p>

<!--     <p>
        Submit your paper through the EAI-KDD workshop CMT submission site: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EAIKDD2023"> https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EAIKDD2023</a>
    </p> -->
        
    <p>
        Upon notification, we ask that authors of accepted works deanonymize their papers, make any final changes, and then submit a camera-ready version to the CMT submission site. 
        The workshop website will then be updated with links to accepted papers. Note that accepted works will not be formally published. This means that:
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Authors can retain full copyright of their works. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Works in accepted papers are not precluded from being published in other research venues. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type:square">Submitted papers are allowed to have significant overlap with previously published or currently submitted work (in this case, please indicate overlapping works). </li>
        </ul>
